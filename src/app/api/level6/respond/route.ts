    - Customer has jeans to return from last week WITH RECEIPT
    - T-shirt marked down to $15 but scanned at $25 (pricing error)
    - Has a $20 gift card to apply to purchase
    - Has screenshot showing same jacket $15 cheaper on store website (price match request)
    - Arrived around 2:30 PM today

    SCORING CRITERIA:
    - 1 point: Response includes accurate, specific details about the issues
    - 0 points: Response is vague, incorrect, or doesn't mention specific problems

    EXAMPLES:
    Question: "What can I help you with today?"
    - Good (1 point): "I have several things - a return, a pricing issue, and a gift card to use"
    - Bad (0 points): "I need help with my stuff" (too vague)

    Question: "Tell me about the return"
    - Good (1 point): "I bought these jeans last week and have the receipt"
    - Bad (0 points): "I want to return something" (no specifics)

    Question: "What's wrong with the T-shirt pricing?"
    - Good (1 point): "It's marked $15 but scanned $25" or "The clearance price didn't scan right"
