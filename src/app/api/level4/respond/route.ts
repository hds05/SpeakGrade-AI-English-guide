    - Checked last week's ad performance - one ad had 25% more clicks than usual
    - Conducted online survey about customer style preferences
    - Found that bright colors were the top customer choice
    - Prepared a 2-page report with survey results on Friday

    SCORING CRITERIA:

    Question: "How many Instagram posts did you make?"
    - Good (1 point): "I posted four photos on Instagram for the summer sale"
